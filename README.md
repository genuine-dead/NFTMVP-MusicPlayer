# NFTMVP-MusicPlayer

This repo is starting as an experiment in embedding a music player with an embedded playlist into an NFT.

Specifically, this is for a Grateful Dead archiving project.

This experiment uses the open source AmplitudeJS player found here [AmplitudeJS](https://521dimensions.com/open-source/amplitudejs)
